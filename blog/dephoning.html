            <h1>Guide to dephoning</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Dephoning, also "unsmarting", is the process of splitting your smartphone up into individual, dedicated devices. The most common reason to dephone is to preserve one's privacy in an age of constant monitoring by not only the world's spy agencies, but also corporate feudal entities attempting to monetise your existence at your expense. The second most common reason to do this is because you realized that you spend too much time on your phone.</p>

            <p>This is your phone (according to always accurate Wikipedia). I don't know who even uses that old phone... oh, sorry! I know one person who uses a phone with Android 4/5/6 and "Material 2"-based Google apps. It's my uncle. His main issuess with this phone aren't "I can't run new apps"-like, but more like "this battery does not charge to more than 75%". He doesn't need a new phone, since he barely uses it.</p>
            <p>But yeah... that's a specific kind of person. I assume you <b>need to use the phone</b>. You have <i>fake</i> friends <i>only on the Internet</i> and you want to text to them... Remember! This is a guide to de-phoning, not a guide to stop using the internet. If you give someone your email, there's a chance that this human would totally ignore this and forget you even existed to the moment when you'll send your next greetings on the chat. E-mail is now kinda abandoned technology and if you need to stay in touch with someone, just move to a computer. There are web versions of nearly every application you use on your phone.</p>
            <p>Also, I don't recommend you to actually not take your phone with you. There may be a situation, where you'll need that electronic device. It's better to turn it off and then wait one minute for it to initialize. You're searching for an instant reward - it's not instant when you need to wait a while for your phone to boot up.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Split your phone to separate devices</h2>
            <p>You won't use it that often, because you won't have any excuse.</p>

            <p>While your smartphone is needed in two points (for basic communication), you can replace some points like <i>Video streaming</i> with a laptop computer (it'll be later in this tutorial). There are some controversial things on this list - for example who even has a battery-powered torch with them? And if you have an old digital camera there is no sense to use it, because it will make worse photos than your phone.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>You should buy a laptop</h2>
            <p>This is a laptop (no, I'm not sponsored by ASUS, I just copied random image from the internet):</p>
            <img src="https://laptopmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3-7-e1678204949389.jpg" alt="">
            <p>You don't need it if you have a desktop PC, but note that you can really use it for most things, that you use your phone to do so, especially for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>gaming</b>: well, download Steam and you have an enormus library of games that you can play.</li>
                <li><b>communicating</b>: Discord has a web version of their app, WhatsApp also has a web version, nearly all of the communication apps exist on desktop. And what's better - if you're on desktop, you can use some features in early-access.</li>
                <li><b>using social media</b>: Instagram, Facebook, even TikTok, they're all available through your web browser. I don't mean you shall use them - yeah, you should stop using them immediatelly, because of these things (including, but not limited to): their algorithms, toxic atmosphere and the fact that no one uses Facebook anymore.</li>
            </ul>
