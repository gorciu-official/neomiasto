    <h1>My unexpected interest</h1>
    <p>I have no freaking idea, why I choose this gif as a thumbnail. I guess there was no other gif that I could use from GifCities. But that GIF probably already told you what was that unexpected interest. But it isn't flying. You're so close, but that's not it.</p>

    <p>I always had a little bit nerdy interests. I'd say I'm interested in computers, but not like "get a Windows/Microsoft Office subscription, use Excel, get a job" computer interest. I was not this kind of human, who explores every single setting in the Seetings app and tells you that he's interested in computers.</p>
    <p>I think I have nerdy interests, because well... people I know are just playing Fortnite/basketball/football all day. I've never told anyone on the Internet that I hate PE (physical education). And the reason I've never played games is simple - my disk had 8 gigs of space left. That wasn't enough to install Fortnite. I recently bought 512GB hard drive to install Linux on it. And since I had already fucked up reputation, I didn't try to install Fortnite on it. Why should I? Games with anti-cheat don't work well on my primary OS. Plus, my OS just tells how nerdy are my interests.</p>
    <p>Nerdy interests... does this tell you anything? Flying... does this combine? Being a pilot? Kind of, but still inaccurate. Being a flight controller? Nope...</p>

    <h2>I wanted to design another flying machine.</h2>
    <p><i>Being a pilot? Kind of, but still inaccurate.</i> This should tell you this. Someone needs to test my new... thing. There are two main inspirations for two main aspects about my machine I wanted to construct:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>territorial ships in the waters of France</b>: they have a really genius thing I wanted to steal... I mean use in my construction. They have sliding hydraulic cylinders with concrete blocks that help stabilize the ship on a full of waves ocean. See where it goes? I wanted to use what I called "anti-tin". In the cockpit there would be a tiny lever rotating 360 degrees. You could control the position of the anti-tinker so that you do not have to evenly break down the luggage.</li>
        <li><b>flyer, in Polish "latalerz" from "Felix, Net i Nika oraz Gang Niewidzialnych Ludzi"</b>: I wanted it to look like this shit. I didn't know what it looked like, but I imagined it was a very flattened, but very flattened (I have to emphasize this because it's not slightly flattened, but somewhere, I'm shooting 200 times more flattened than a regular bullet, almost flat, but not) bullet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So I called my construction the same. In order to this I started studying <b>aerodynamics</b>. And that is this super interest.</p>

    <p>update: I know I might not do this, don't judge me for random ideas</p>
