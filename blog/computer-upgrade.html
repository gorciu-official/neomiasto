            <p>I don't usually spend money on upgrading things. I use an old phone with Android 9 and it's enough for me. I don't upgrade my phone every year, because something new came out. I don't feel like there's enough innovation in some places for me to switch. Why should I use a better camera when I don't have issues with my old one. Unless I really need something or something's broken (and I can't fix this myself), I don't upgrade.</p>

            <h2>How my computer looks outside?</h2>
            <p>I decided that my SATA drives (with Linux, with Windows and with my data) stay untouched. Because I had a budget, updating the case wasn't on my priority list. It still looks like this.</p>

            <p>The only visible differences are the front panel (it's deprecated and I'm actively looking for a new one) and a Ryzen 9 5000 series stamp, which is not shown here.</p>

            <h2>What's inside?</h2>
            <p>Most of the things are here:</p>
            <div class="center" style="width:100%;margin-bottom:10px;">
                <iframe src="/tools.html" frameborder="0" style="width:95%;height:500px;"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>This is my <a href="/tools.html">Tools page</a>, so go check it on a wider screen from a navigation bar after you finish reading this article.</p>
            <p>If you want to see the list not from iFrame, here it is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Motherboard</b>: I chose AORUS A520 ELITE. I heard from one person that it's a terrible motherboard, but I don't think so. I care more about CPU and RAM. <a href="#motherboard-image">View image</a>.<br><img class="if-not-target-hide" id="motherboard-image" src="https://www.gigabyte.com/Image/761/Product/25801//webp/600" alt="" style="max-width:800px;"></li>
                <li><b>Memory</b>: 32GiB of DDR4 memory (kinda deprecated, DDR6 is coming out this year, but DDR4 is still great and useful; for me that's more than enough). <a href="#ram-image">View image</a>.<br><img class="if-not-target-hide" id="ram-image" src="https://image.ceneostatic.pl/data/products/111801433/f-pamiec-ram-kingston-fury-fury-beast-ddr4-32-gb-3200mhz-cl16-kf432c16bb1k2-32.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:800px;"></li>
                <li><b>CPU</b>: Ryzen 9 5950X (I did GPU bottleneck, but I don't care). <a href="#cpu-image">View image</a>.<br><img class="if-not-target-hide" id="cpu-image" src="https://cdn.x-kom.pl/i/setup/images/prod/big/product-new-big,,2020/10/pr_2020_10_9_14_6_57_190_00.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:800px;"></li>
            </ul>
            <p>And if you're wondering about my graphics card... Yes... I have a GPU bottleneck. I decided to not upgrade AMD Radeon HD 8490.</p>

            <h2>What WAS inside?</h2>
            <p>For CPU I was using Intel Core 2 Quad Q9300. It wasn't enough for what I was doing and it doesn't support virtualization. Internet says it was never a high-end. It was paired with 6 gigs of DDR2 memory (I'm not joking - DDR<b>2</b>) and with ASUS P5Q PRO motherboard. That motherboard was horrible, mostly because it had destroyed memory controller (I don't know why, don't ask me).</p>
            <p>Even though I was using SSDs for my old computer, it was kinda useless. The maximum speed of HDD drive is about 250 Megabytes per second. Compare that with maximum speed of SATA II - 300 Megabytes per second. The difference is <i>*shocking*</i> 50 Megabytes per second. So I could say these SSDs were useless.</p>
