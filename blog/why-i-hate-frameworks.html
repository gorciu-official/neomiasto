    <h1>why do i hate frameworks</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>i hate frameworks, this was confirmed in old about page, this was confirmed in my previous blog post and this was confirmed on my dependency list. so i decided to do some research why do i hate these fucking frameworks. what's wrong with me?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>i found number one which is intellectual control and understanding. understanding what? when i want to see something in the code of big project i usually can't find what i'm looking for. so maybe i just don't understand the code and i like to write my own, understandable... maybe.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>let's continue.</p>

        When something breaks inside a framework, you're at the mercy of someone else's code quality and documentation
    </p>
    <p>i said I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING IN THE OTHER PEOPLE'S CODE. and i don't like scrolling through the documentation. i usually find an answer on stack overflow.</p>

        It's often more effort to remove unnecessary features than to write your own minimal version

    <p>it reminded me of WinAPI, which is totally shit. WinRE is also totally shit because it uses async and await all the time and the names are incredibly long. okay, but why do i think WinAPI is shit. because it fucks up your global namespace with casing i don't use, functions i don't use and i'm afraid that i can name the function the same as the WinAPI equivalment. putting it all into a namespace doesn't work well and the compiler crashes. creating an alternative? no, no, no, it imports this shit from DLLs, to rewrite DLLs you have to do syscall which are blocked by the compiler. <b>what... the... fuck</b>.</p>
    <p>it did not explained anything. please tell me what's wrong with me.</p>
