    <h1>How to replace your charging board?</h1>
    <div class="warn" style="margin-bottom:10px;padding:10px;background-color:black;color:red;">This guide is mostly for Huawei P10 / VTR-L29. I don't know how it works in modern phones, if you're using something else, please take it not as a instruction, but a suggestion.<br>Also, it's not my buissness if you break something. And if the phone is still on warranty, never do this, unless you have a valid reason to do not use warranty.</div>
    <p>This is an USB-C cable (Wikipedia's image):</p>
    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/USB_Type-C_plug_20170626_crop.jpg/512px-USB_Type-C_plug_20170626_crop.jpg" alt="an USB-C port" style="max-width:128px;"></p>
    <p>Now imagine you plug in this cable into your smartphone and nothing. It does not charge ot it does, but in an one specific angle... But there is the <span style="background-color:black;color:red;">dark side</span> of this: every time you use that "construction" to charge your phone it gets <b>worse</b>. And if you tried mutiple cables, or at least a cable and the headphones and <b>none</b> of them work, you'll be absolutelly 100% freaking sure that the issue is your phone's USB-C port.</p>

    <h2>The charging board is not your motherboard!!!</h2>
    <p>It's connected to your motherboard, but you can easily change just your charging board. Do not believe to anyone who says you that:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-image: url(/img/rainbowbullet.gif);padding:30px;">
        <li><b>"you won't be able to access your internal memory afterwards"</b> - please note: it's still not your motherboard and changing that has nothing to do with your phone's memory</li>
        <li><b>"you'll make your phone a freaking brick"</b> - and what do you think it is now? every second it drains battery. eventually it will become a brick, so why not try unbricking it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And if your warranty can do it for free, use that right, instead of doing it yourself. BUT if your warranty has expired, fixing it by a professional will be worth more than that phone.</p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>First make sure that you have bought the right charging board <b>for your specific phone</b>. If you have more than one of these, try to not unpack the second charging board. <span style="background-color:black;color:red;">If your second piece will be unpacked, in case when you have to replace this again, it may be broken (for example it may be charging always, except for that one angle)</span>. Then, make sure you even know how to use USB-C to not brick another one.</p>
    <p>These new ports have less plastic wear, so you'll need more force to pull them out. And don't do it the "smart way", because that's how you'll break another board. Always pull the cable out of the port by pulling it toward you. If you start jerking it left and right to pull it out, you'll eventually end up in the same situation you're in now - having to replace the board. <b>And these plastics are always less strong than original ones. Be aware that you can break the replacements faster.</b></p>

    <h2>How I did this?</h2>
    <p>Basically, there are these screws near the charging port. They're usually very, very small, and you need the right screwdriver for them. And you guessed it, you have to unscrew them.</p>
    <p>Then you have to remove the screen, which is a problem. I personally damaged the protective glass in one spot with a screen removal tool (no, I'm not a phone repairman, I don't know where I got it). When I opened the phone to replace the screen and battery, I didn't care, but when I changed the port, it was the other way around - you had to be careful, because the screen would be returned untouched. And I almost forgot that no, you don't have to remove the glass/film from the screen.</p>
    <p>You know those ribbon cables? Now it's time to detach them all. You insert the new board, connect the ribbon cable to the battery... and you're done? NO! The hardest part happens to be putting it back in the right place... careful, you didn't think about that... the Wi-Fi ANTENNAS, because there's a place on the board where you have to insert it. Believe me, it's not difficult, but it's time-consuming. I managed to do it, but I heard from someone that they broke the antenna. So you have to be careful... I guess...</p>
    <p>Finally, make your phone a phone and not a set of electronics. Just undo the changes described in first and second paragraph of this section.</p>

    <h2>Unclear?</h2>
    <p>I did it without a tutorial, but there is a more graphical-oriented tutorial (80% accurate with what I did), so go <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Huawei+P10+Charging+Board+Replacement/103702" target="_blank">read it</a>. <b>I recommend you to skip the seventh point and ignore the warning visible in the eight point.</b></p>
