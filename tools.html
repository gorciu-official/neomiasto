        <p>Let's take a look at <i>some things from</i> my neofetch output:</p>
        <ul class="neofetch">
            <li><b>OS:</b> Arch Linux</li>
            <li><b>Shell:</b> Bash</li>
            <li><b>Terminal:</b> konsole/kitty/VSCode built-in</li>
            <li><b>DE:</b> KDE Plasma (stylized to look like GNOME)</li>
            <li><b>WM:</b> KWin</li>
            <li><b>X11/Wayland:</b> Wayland</li>
            <li><b>CPU:</b> Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad Q9300 (4) @ 2.50 GHz</li>
            <li><b>GPU:</b> AMD Radeon HD 8490 / R5 235X OEM</li>
        </ul>
        <marquee behavior="alternate" truespeed scrolldelay="30" style="margin-bottom:10px;color:yellow;">you really have that much of a shitty computer? you can't even afford intel core 2 duo lmfao</marquee>
        <p>Yeah, I was thinking that switching to Linux will fix 99% of my problems... <span class="spoiler">My problems = segfaults, random apps closing, VSC crashing all the time, something went wrong while rendering this webpage.</span><br>It didn't happen. Let's hope I'll get a new computer.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="tcenter">because i'm a developer you're probably interested in something coding-related, right?</p>
        <h2>let's get into code</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I use two code editors:</p>
        <ul class="neofetch">
            <li><b>Visual Studio Code</b> is my primary code editor. I use it when... you guessed it right - I want to code something.</li>
            <li><b>Neovim</b> is my secondary code editor. I'd rather say it's my [hyprland/kitty/{insert any tool here}] config editor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd be very happy if I could replace all of my programming works with Neovim. It does not crash that often (I can't even write code for 15 minutes without any crash because that's too hard for VSCode), but it has its problems that prevent me from doing this. For example it does not make my code properly formatted. I need to do it myself. I don't want very much, the only my requirements are to place one new line character and then enough tabs, like VSC does by default.</p>
        <br>
        <marquee behavior="alternate" truespeed scrolldelay="30" style="margin-bottom:10px;color:red;">do you even know what are dependencies? i want your dependecies!!!</marquee>
        <p>Okay... i don't like being dependent, but i also can't/i'm too lazy to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>reinvent the wheel by making my own CPU with my own architecure and by making my own hard drive, my own RAM, my own GPU, my own ECAM a.k.a PCI ECAM a.k.a electronic centralised aircraft monitor a.k.a pci enhanced configuration access mechanism</li>
            <li>make my own programming language</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So... i have dependencies. let's copy paste something from the previous page...</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>jsdom</b> - I'm too lazy to rewrite I don't know how much files just to get some random property from document object model a.k.a DOM</li>
            <li><b>grub</b> - I'm also too lazy to rewrite a bootloader and grub is okay enough</li>
            <li><b>gcc and g++</b> - I said <i>every time i was trying to make a programming language [...] i failed</i>, that's the reason</li>
            <li><b>node</b> - same as gcc and g++</li>
            <li><b>typescript</b> - this npm library extending JavaScript is awesome. It's so awesome I could not recreate it (maybe because it's a programming language)</li>
        </ul>
