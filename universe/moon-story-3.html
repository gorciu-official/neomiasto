    <p>You start doing random things. You still have no idea on how to open the door. It was like two hours. And then you used the built-in radio. Hoping Neil is on the same frequency, you start asking:</p>
    <p>- Hello, is anyone here? I'm stuck in the LM.</p>
    <p>He IS on the same frequency. He told you how to open the door. You opened it. He was out for such a long time, because he found the Moon's underground life. He found aliens. And you gave him totally random information, that helped him find them. He's now okay with you on the mission.</p>
    <p>What do you want to do?<br><a href="/universe/earth.html">Return to Earth with Neil and pretend nothing happened</a> | <a href="/universe/life.html">Go to aliens</a></p>
