                    <p>Welcome at our vault. We store here the most unexpected things. If you're wondering who we are, we're aliens. We're living on the moon. We started to hide underground everything we had, including all the Moon's water. We constructed this vault to look like underground mineral, but hide a secret entrance. We were curious when the humans will figure it out.</p>
                    <p>So... welcome, you're the first two people who discovered us. And only to these two people, I'll show, what we hide from you, humans. Go with me, click the portal below.</p>
