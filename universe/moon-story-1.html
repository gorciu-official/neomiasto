    <p>You go to Neil Armstrong. He's still mad that NASA gived you and not some other, more prepared person. This time you think he'll help you, because he wants to return to the Earth as soon as possible. So, you're preparing to ask him...</p>
    <p>- Neil, how to open the exit door to get to the Moon? - you asked. - Neil, are you here?</p>
    <p>He went to moon without you even noticing it. You were in the bathroom, maybe he leaved at that very moment.</p>
    <p>You have two choices:<br><a href="/universe/moon-story-2.html">Cut down some power for the emergency catapult and try escaping the Lunar Module</a> | <a href="/universe/moon-story-3.html">Wait until he goes back</a></p>
