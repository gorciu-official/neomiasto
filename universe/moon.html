    <h1>Hello on the Moon!</h1>
    <p>You have just landed on the Moon with Neil Armstrong. Let's explore everything that's here, and everything you can explore.</p>
    <p>You're preparing to quit the lunar module. You have no idea on how to exit it. You wanted to figure it out by looking on the <a href="https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11" target="_blank">Apollo 11's guidance computer source code</a>, but you forgot that there's no internet there and that you can't read dot agc files. And then you realized that reading this code will not get you out of this situation.</p>
    <p>What are you going to do? You have two options:<br><a href="/universe/moon-story-1.html">Ask Neil Armstrong from instructions on how to open the door</a> | <a href="/universe.html">Use emergency catapult to get out of the Lunar Module, but also out of the moon</a></p>
