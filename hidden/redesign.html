    <h1>Thing called redesign</h1>
    <div class="center" style="margin: 10px 0;">
        <img src="/img/redesign.png" alt="redesign" class="cenrow">

    <p><b>I have recently redesigned my website. It was a move inspired by <a href="https://melonking.net/" target="_blank">this website</a>, which moved my site from static site generator to something that is not same-ish.</b></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Before construction works</h2>
    <p>Take a look at the previous site:</p>
    <div class="center" style="margin: 10px 0;">
        <img src="/img/design.png" alt="design" class="cenrow">
    </div>
    <p>I have totally scrapped the old website. Well, it was okay, but too basic. One site required minimal effort to put it online. Only shrines had different page layout. And that was wrong. I know that development speed is important, but I also wanted to distinguish sites.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>My inspiration</h2>
    <p>I was scrolling Neocities and I stumbled across this site. I do think that this explains everything:</p>
    <div class="center" style="margin: 10px 0;">
        <img src="https://neocities.org/site_screenshots/32/72/melonking/melon.html.540x405.webp" alt="inspiration" class="cenrow">
    </div>
    <p>Let's take yet another look at my website.</p>
    <div class="center" style="margin: 10px 0;">
        <img src="/img/redesign.png" alt="redesign" class="cenrow">
    </div>
    <p>Don't you see the difference?</p>
    <p>I'm really sure you saw it. This website was awesome and inspired me to make my site even better.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>The point of redesign</h2>
    <p>I have made my website an iframe-based website. That helped me distinguish webpages. There is a common stylesheet, which allows me to add global classes styles and much more. I don't have to rewrite everything.</p>
    <p>But... what was the point? Who knows... I was just inspired.</p>
