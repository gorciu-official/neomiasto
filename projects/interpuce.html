    <p>Interpuce is kind of dead right now, but at the time it made projects... Cool projects... All of them are open source, so you can go check them out <a href="https://github.com/Interpuce" target="_blank">here</a>! And you can still view <a href="/projects/interpuce-old.html">old Interpuce page</a>.</p>

            <h2>AurorOS</h2>
            <p>Flagship product? I don't think so... But yeah, it's the most important project I have ever done. The golden age of AurorOS was its private beta. It looked like that shell in the Interpuce article thumbnail. Recently I have made a <a href="https://github.com/Interpuce/AurorOS/releases/latest" target="_blank">a bugfix release</a>, so definitelly try booting it.</p>
            <p>If you want to learn more about AurorOS, the best source is right <a href="https://eklerka25.fandom.com/pl/wiki/AurorOS" target="_blank">there</a> at the eclairbakery fandom (psstt... i made a shrine about eclairbakery right over <a href="/shrines/eclairbakery.html">here</a>), I recommend you to Google Translate the site. At the time we even had a Wikipedia's page, but they quickly removed it.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Previous generation of AurorOS (a.k.a Interpuce/PreviousAurorOS)</h2>
            <p>This was the longest and the most reused AurorOS. The problem was that it had extreme, wrong codebase and functions that didn't work as expected, but they were left, because why not have a broken feature.</p>
            <p>And it was at the time when ChatGPT evolved. I didn't understand most of the advanced code and I often used AI to write code. And the very same AI that was losing the big AI battle.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>The standard library for AurorOS<br><span style="font-family:monospace;color:orangered;margin-left: 10px;"># DEPRECATED #</span></h2>
            <p>This deprecated on 1st May 2025 project was an addition to <a href="https://github.com/Interpuce/AurorOS/tree/project-vernon" target="_blank">Project Vernon</a>, my old attempt to make current AurorOS better. It was requested by <a href="https://github.com/Fivvee0" target="_blank">Fivvee0</a> and I added it without making an actually good project.</p>
